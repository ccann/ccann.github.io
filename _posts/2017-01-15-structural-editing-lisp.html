<p>
In addition to the functionality provided by <code>clojure-mode</code> and <code>CIDER</code> I use <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy">lispy</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el">clj-refactor</a> to round out my tooling needs. Each of these packages is deep. I mean really
deep. I'm constantly revisiting each of them to see if there's a new command I can adopt
or a hidden gem I've missed.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that these packages complement each other really well &#x2013; I wouldn't describe
them as competing tools even if they do have some functionality overlap. <code>clj-refactor</code>
provides a host of one-off edit recipes (e.g. add a <code>require</code> to the namespace) while
<code>lispy</code> provides a composable bottom-up approach to structural editing. Finding the time
to invest into using each of these to their fullest extent is hard and as such I've
focused the most on digesting and incorporating <code>lispy</code> paired with a pretty small subset
of the <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki#available-refactorings">available <code>clj-refactor</code> refactorings</a>, mostly project and namespace-related.
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ap</code> <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-add-project-dependency">Add project dependency</a>
My absolute favorite refactoring. Hotload a dependency. Saves you having to visit
<code>project.clj</code> and, more importantly, <code>cider-jack-in</code> again after adding a dep to
<code>project.clj</code>. But there's more! You get to choose from all available projects and
version numbers without leaving your editor to hunt them down. This is especially nice
since I'm constantly forgetting the <code>groupid</code> of the libraries I frequently use. I tend
to follow this one up with an <code>ar</code> of course.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>am</code> <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-add-missing-libspec">Add missing libspec</a>
My second favorite. Require or import based on the symbol at point. If I'm going to
refer, e.g. a function, into my namespace from a library that I haven't required yet I
can just type the name of the function and then <code>C-c C-m am</code> the full libspec into my
<code>ns</code> form. With some of the more common libs this happens automatically when you type a
commonly used namespace alias like <code>(str/...</code> for <code>clojure.string</code> but this has you
covered for all other cases.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ar</code> <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-add-require-to-ns">Add require to namespace definition</a>
I use this when I know I want to alias an entire namespace instead of <code>:refer</code> -ing
specific vars.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ai</code> <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-add-import-to-ns">Add import to namespace declaration</a>
The title pretty much sums this one up.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>cn</code> <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-clean-ns">Clean ns</a>
Cleans up your namespace. I love using this after I've been working with a namespace
for a while to clean up unused deps and for the clean, easily digestable <code>ns</code> form.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>rf</code> <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-rename-file-or-dir">Rename file or dir</a>
I'm constantly moving namespaces around. Saves you having to update the <code>ns</code> form
manually and remembering to use underscores instead of dashes in the file name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As for <code>lispy</code> there's similarly <a href="http://oremacs.com/lispy/">a lot to like</a>. Some of my favorite bits are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>q</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>t</code>: some of the <code>ace-</code> commands. Navigating the point to an open paren like
this is awesome. I love that both are one key away (which is the case for most of
these, but still!). <code>a</code> is especially great for deleting, copying symbols. <code>t</code> for
teleporting expressions and regions is immensely useful.</li>

<li><code>v</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>W</code>: recentering the view is great for ergonomics. I use vertical monitors
and <code>v</code> let's me mindlessly pull what I'm editing into view instead of craning my
neck. <code>N</code> for narrowing has a similar use-case but with the added benefit of allowing
you to focus on just that expression. This is a really nice way to focus up.</li>

<li><code>i</code>: fix up whitespace and indentation with a single keystroke. Yes please.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both <code>lispy</code> and <code>clj-refactor</code> also require very little configuration. I'll leave you
with my configs if you want to get started with either package and need a jumping off
point. Oh, and lastly, I'd like to express my gratitude to the authors of these
packages: <b>thank you so much for what you do!</b>
